Hi there, this is **Simon** with a **new article** I have written. 

This email is automated based on my [RSS feed](https://www.ssp.sh/index.xml) and sent out whenever I publish a new article. For quite a while, I haven't updated you on new posts since I switched from Mailchimp to Listmonk, but now I activated this feature again. I hope you enjoy this; otherwise, please let me know. I will still send my irregular updates (every 2-4 months) in addition.

But I figured that in times when social media is a little depressing, I want to give you a chance to stay updated just by emailâ€”no need to log in anywhere. 
BR Simon
